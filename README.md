# JavaScript: Division by Zero and Zero Input Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving division by zero and unexpected behavior when both inputs are zero.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description:

The original function `foo` does not handle the cases where `b` is zero or both `a` and `b` are zero, leading to errors or unexpected results. 

## Solution:

The solution adds error handling to gracefully manage these situations, preventing runtime errors and providing informative feedback.
